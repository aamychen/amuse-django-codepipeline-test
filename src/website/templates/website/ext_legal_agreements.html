                <p>Please carefully read the following music distribution agreement (“Distribution Agreement”), which creates a legally binding, enforceable contract between you and Amuseio AB regarding your use of our digital distribution services and the distribution-related elements of the Amuse Service. Throughout this Distribution Agreement, “us” “our” and “we” refers to Amuseio AB; and “you” or “Content Distributor” refers to you, the content distributor  (“Amuse Account”). This Distribution Agreement supersedes and replaces any prior agreements you and Amuse may have executed with respect to the Catalog (defined below). The terms of this Distribution Agreement supplement and do not limit our Terms of Use, Copyright Policy, and Privacy Policy, to which you have already accepted by using the Service, and which this Distribution Agreement incorporates by reference. In the event of a conflict between these terms and any other agreements between you and Amuse, including without limitation the Terms of Use, Copyright Policy and Privacy Policy, the terms of this Distribution Agreement shall govern unless provided otherwise in a separate signed written between you and Amuse.</p>
                <p>BY CLICKING THAT YOU AGREE TO THE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT, YOU UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY AND BECOME A PARTY TO THESE TERMS, WHETHER YOU ARE ACTING IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY OR AS THE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE FOR AN ARTIST, A GROUP OR A CORPORATION, IN WHICH CASE “YOU” SHALL REFER TO THE ARTIST, GROUP OR CORPORATION ON WHOSE BEHALF YOU ARE ACTING AND AUTHORIZED TO ACT. IF YOU DO NOT UNCONDITIONALLY AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, CLICK THE “CANCEL” BUTTON. THE “EFFECTIVE DATE” OF THIS DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT IS THE DATE ON WHICH YOU CLICK THE “AGREE” BUTTON BELOW.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>SCOPE OF AGREEMENT</h4>
                <p>Amuse provides digital distribution services, as well as digital asset management services, including metadata management, catalog encoding, royalty collection and reporting services to artists, artist managers and other owners and distributors of content. You, the Content Distributor, are in the business of recording, producing and/or marketing sound recordings, musical compositions, and/or other intellectual property owned, administered or distributed by you.</p>
                <p>This Distribution Agreement covers digital distribution and other rights in and to the copyrights associated with the content you submit to us, including any and all current and future sound recordings and any underlying musical and literary compositions embodied in such content (the “Music”). Additionally, this Distribution Agreement covers all other digital assets and the rights thereto, including without limitation, album covers and other artwork, image files, marketing materials, trade names, trademarks, and logos, etc., that you submit to us (“Digital Assets”). Together, the Music and the Digital Assets shall be referred to collectively as the Catalog (“Catalog”). You may from time to time elect to add to the Catalog by logging into your account in the back-end content distribution and management system provided through the Service (“Amuse Artist Dashboard”) and supplying new content or amending existing content, the submission or amendment of which shall be subject to the terms of this Distribution Agreement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>TERM</h4>
                <p>For any individual track or album within the Catalog, this Distribution Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until either you, by logging into the Service and changing your settings, or we, by sending you an email, submit a termination request.</p>
                <p>Within ten (10) days following the submitting of a termination request pursuant to Section 3.1 above with respect to an individual track or album or your entire Catalog (“Withdrawn Content”), Amuse shall notify all relevant Third Party Music Services about the termination and request the removal of the Withdrawn Content from such Third Party Music Services. If you submit a termination request pursuant to Section 10 of the Terms Of Use in relation to your Amuse Account, Amuse will treat this as a termination request with respect of your entire Catalog. You understand and agree that Amuse’s obligations upon the termination of this Distribution Agreement shall be limited to the aforesaid, and under no circumstances shall Amuse be liable for any Third Party Music Service’s failure to promptly remove the Withdrawn Content following its receipt of Amuse’s request thereof.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>RIGHTS YOU GRANT US</h4>
                <p>Subject to this Distribution Agreement you hereby authorize Amuse to store, copy and distribute your Catalog to any consumer and B2B digital music stores, distributors and other third-party services available to you through the Service (“Third Party Music Services”).</p>
                <p>To the extent necessary for Amuse to facilitate the distribution to Third Party Music Services authorized by you in the Artist Settings section of the Amuse Artist Dashboard, you hereby grant to Amuse the right and authorization to distribute, license, sell, stream, transmit, synchronize (as applicable, only with visual images embodied within videos on YouTube), perform, promote, and otherwise exploit such Catalog and any and all rights in and to the sound recording(s) and the underlying composition(s) in such Catalog, throughout the world, in any and all media or formats now known or hereafter devised, including without limitation by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>permanent digital downloads;</li>
                    <li>temporary digital downloads;</li>
                    <li>interactive streaming;</li>
                    <li>non-interactive streaming;</li>
                    <li>interactive radio; and</li>
                    <li>non-interactive radio (DMCA compliant, compulsory license);</li>
                    <li>Semi-interactive radio (voluntary license);</li>
                    <li>The servicing of any and all “existing” and “to be” developed digital and mobile delivery methods.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You authorize Amuse to sub-license any rights granted by you under this Distribution Agreement to any Third Party Music Services, as required to provide the Service hereunder. The authorization and grant of rights hereundershall be exclusive as to the Third Party Music Services, authorized in the Amuse Artist Dashboard.</p>
                <p>Amuse does not guarantee placement of the Catalog with any Third Party Music Services and reserves the right to remove any content from the Service and reject distribution of any content in its discretion.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>YOUR OBLIGATIONS TO OTHERS</h4>
                <p>In connection with exploitation of the Catalog contemplated hereunder, you shall be solely responsible for (a) all record royalties due to artists, producers and other persons who performed in the making of the Music and other royalty participants, (b) all royalties due to any party as a result of samples included in the Music (c) all payments that may be required under collective bargaining agreements applicable to you and your affiliates, and (d) all music publishing licenses and royalties.</p>
                <p>For digital download sales in the United States, your payment typically includes the mechanical royalty on the underlying composition. In the case of the iTunes Match service, your payment includes a publishing portion that covers both the mechanical and public performance royalties. If you do not own or control the underlying composition(s) in your sound recording(s), it is your obligation to pay these publishing royalties to the person or entity that does. Outside of the United States, Amuse customarily requires Third Party Music Services to secure and pay for music publishing licenses (and such license fees may or may not be deducted by the Third Party Music Services concerned from the proceeds payable to Amuse). If any Third Party Music Service outside of the United States does not agree to secure and pay for music publishing licenses, Amuse shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to either (i) decline to license such Third Party Music Service or (b) assume the responsibility to clear and pay for the music publishing licenses required in connection with such Third Party Music Service’s sales, which license fees Amuse shall have the right to deduct from amounts payable to you hereunder.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>REVENUE / PAYMENT</h4>
                <p>Amuse will pay Content Distributor one-hundred percent (100%) of any Net Royalties received from the authorized Third Party Music Services. “Net Royalties” as used herein means Amuse’s actual receipts from the Third Party Music Services for the sale, distribution or other use of your Catalog, less any (a) tax, bank transfer and PayPal or other payment services transaction fees (if any); (b) marketplace costs, including without limitation any fees, payments, royalties or other consideration payable by Amuse to song aggregators and digital retail stores; and (c) licensing fees and royalties payable to song publishing licensors and compulsory mechanical licensors, as applicable.</p>
                <p>Content Distributor shall be solely responsible for tracking and paying any taxes and governmental fees associated with or incurred in exploitation of the Catalog through the Service, including without limitation any tariffs, value-added taxes or governmental fees.</p>
                <p>Accounting statements and your Net Royalties will be posted to your Amuse user account in a timely fashion after Amuse’s receipt thereof. Once payment has been credited to your Amuse user account, you will be able to withdraw the outstanding amount at your discretion. Your balance must exceed a minimum of USD 10 to withdraw money from your account. You will be solely responsible for any bank transfer and third party transaction fees or other charges related to such withdrawals.</p>
                <p>Unless other payment arrangements are made between you and Amuse, Amuse shall remit payment to you according to the settings in your Amuse Dashboard.</p>
                <p>Content Distributor shall have the right to appoint a certified public accountant who has signed confidentiality agreement with respect to Amuse’s books, to audit Amuse’s books and records to verify the accuracy of such statements, once with respect to any statement, once in each year, at Content Distributor’s expense, at the place where Amuse maintains such records, during Amuse’s normal business hours and on at least thirty (30) days’ prior notice. All objections concerning payments hereunder shall be submitted by Content Distributor within one (1) year after the date of payment, after which time all objections shall be waived.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>PROCESSING YOUR CONTENT</h4>
                <p>Subsequent to your acceptance of this Distribution Agreement, and your delivery of the digital files of the Music with accurate metadata and cover artwork that fulfil the requirements set forth on the Amuse Artist Dashboard, Amuse may deliver the Music and applicable Digital Assets to the selected Third Party Music Services.</p>
                <p>You may indefinitely withhold any of the Music from any store(s) of your choosing by selecting the appropriate option in the Amuse Artist Dashboard prior to the submission of the release. You may also, after withholding Music from a particular store, email support@amuse.com to request delivery of the Music to such store, at Amuse’s discretion.</p>

            <li>
                <h4>WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER</h4>

You also hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Amuse and those authorized by Amuse to use and/or exploit the Catalog harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, costs, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable counsel fees and litigation expenses, arising out of the use of the Catalog as contemplated hereunder. If a claim is made, Amuse reserves the right to withhold payment of royalties hereunder in an amount reasonably related to the claim and potential expenses.</p>
                <p>If you are acting for the benefit of, and/or as an agent or representative of any artist, individual, group, or corporation, you and the parties that you represent shall be bound to the terms of this Distribution Agreement and shall be jointly and severally liable for your breach of the Distribution Agreement and for breach of the Distribution Agreement by any of the parties you represent.</p>
